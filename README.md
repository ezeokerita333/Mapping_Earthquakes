# Overview
The purpose of this project was to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates location on the earth, all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and lastly the data on a third map.

# Tasks
To use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website, retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

# Summary
We used the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Also used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data.
